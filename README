SLACK TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
By: Michael Deng

INTEGRATION

To integrate this game into a new Slack channel, go to the App Directory 
and search for Slash Commands. Click on Add Configuration and choose an
appropriate command (like '/ttt'). In the URL section of Integration Settings, 
put 'https://slack-game-michaeldeng.herokuapp.com/' (or whatever web service 
you want to host this game on). As for the Token, you need to explicitly add 
that to the code.

To increase the board size, change the BOARD_SIZE variable and add additional 
moves to the MOVES dictionary in the constants.py file.

INSTALL

To install this app on your computer, you should have python (this app was
tested using Python 2.7) and a virtual environment. Clone the github repo 
and type 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. You can configure the database
by changing the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI in the config.py file.

TODO

1. Allow players to forfeit.
2. Detect draws early.
3. Save teams that have been validated once.
4. Forfeit players when they disconnect.
5. Put a timer on each turn and forfeit players who take too long.
6. Generate an external documentation with Sphinx.
7. Refactor some of the repeated code blocks.
